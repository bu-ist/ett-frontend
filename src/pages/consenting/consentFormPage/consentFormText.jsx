                The institutions and societies that are using the Ethical Transparency Tool are committed to providing a climate and culture where all are welcome and able to thrive, for the sake of our community members and to advance our integrity, excellence, and earned public trust. While people found responsible for misconduct may learn lessons, change conduct, and regain trust, transparency is important.  Not knowing about findings of sexual, gender, and racial/ethnic misconduct, along with certain other ethical misconduct, prevents us from achieving the climate and culture we value.
