            Registering your organization to use ETT also means that in your official and personal capacities you have read and agree to the ETT Privacy Notice and Privacy Policy and consent on your own and your organization’s behalf to inclusion of your organization’s name, with or without its representative(s) names, titles and contact information (as you reflect them during registration) on the ETT database and in ETT-related communications, factually stating that your organization is or was registered to use ETT or is or was an ETT-Registered Entity (including but not limited to putting your organization’s name, with or without its representative(s)’ names and contact information, on a list of ETT-Registered Entities). Your organization’s and representatives’ information will be removed from lists of then-current ETT-Registered Entities upon termination of this registration. (ETT may be abbreviated or spelled out as the Ethical Transparency Tool.)  Lists of ETT-Registered Entities (with or without their representative(s) names and contact information) may be used to operate, publicize, and recruit additional entities to use ETT.  Any such reference will not include an endorsement of ETT or state the specific way (within all the permitted ways) in which your organization is or was using ETT, without your additional written consent.  Mere listing of your organization as an ETT-Registered Entity is not deemed an endorsement. ETT may communicate aggregated data on the way ETT-Registered Entities use ETT.
