            Registering your organization to use ETT also means that you consent on your own and your organization’s behalf 
            to inclusion of your organization’s name, with or without its representative(s) name and contact information 
            (as reflected in the registration form) on the ETT database and in ETT-related communications, factually stating that your organization 
            is or was registered to use ETT or is or was an ETT-Registered Entity. This agreement and consent includes but is not 
            limited to putting your organization’s name, with or without its representative(s)’ names and contact information, 
            on a list of ETT-Registered Entities that is made publicly available. Your organization’s and representatives’ information 
            will be removed from lists of current ETT-Registered Entities upon termination of the organization’s registration.  
            If there is a change in an ETT-Registered Entity’s Authorized Representative(s), the removed representative(s) will be 
            removed from lists of current ETT-Registered Entities; successors will then be included.  Lists of ETT-Registered Entities 
            (with or without their representative(s) names and contact information) may be used to operate, publicize, and recruit 
            additional entities to use ETT and to support ETT-Registered Entities’ ability to use ETT efficiently.  Any such reference 
            will not include an endorsement of ETT or state the specific way (within all the permitted ways) in which your organization 
            is or was using ETT, unless an Authorized Individual gives additional written consent.  (ETT may be abbreviated or spelled 
            out as the Ethical Transparency Tool.)
            <br />Mere listing of your organization and its representatives as an ETT-Registered Entity is not deemed an endorsement. 
            ETT may communicate aggregated data on the way ETT-Registered Entities use ETT and the impact of the tool.
