            <b>Privacy Notice:</b> ETT is hosted on a server and kept on computers in the United States, governed by United States law.  If you are a citizen of or reside in another country, the privacy laws of that home country (or its states, provinces, or other divisions) may be more protective than U.S. laws. Subject to applicable U.S. laws, ETT has been reasonably designed to protect against ETT itself transferring your personal or entity information to anyone other than those meant to receive it within the ETT design. However, your data on servers and computers in the U.S. may be subject to production by us in response to access requests or orders from governments, courts, subpoenas, law enforcement officials and national security authorities in the U.S. under U.S. or state/local laws.  See Parts D, E, and F below on what we do and do not do to limit disclosure of personal information.
