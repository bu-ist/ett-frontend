                in its discretion, to get individualsâ€™ consents to disclosures of findings of misconduct about them and to make disclosures requests 
                to the entities that may have made or adopted findings.  ETT does not receive any disclosures or conduct records.  It is not a policy 
                and does not dictate or guide decisions or policies, including, e.g., for which Privileges or Honors, Employment or Roles  ETT is used, 
                how to weigh findings, or who is qualified or should be selected.

                Authorized Individuals (AIs) should be in senior institutional roles, accustomed to managing sensitive
                and confidential information, and knowledgeable about the ETT-Registered Entity. Administrative Support Professionals
                (ASPs) should also be accustomed to managing sensitive and confidential information. An ETT-Registered Entity
                determines these roles/people.

                Either ETT-Registered Entity&rsquo;s AI may update who is an AI or ASP. However, ETT will send a copy of the
                change to the other AI and ASP (at least one) serving at the time for security of the information. ETT will also copy the
                removed AI or ASP.

                The ASP may initiate Disclosure Requests in ETT only when directed by an AI. ASPs will be blind copied
                on Disclosure Requests to aid AIs in tracking. <b>Only</b> AIs are visibly copied on Disclosure Requests and should be the <b>direct
                recipients</b> of completed Disclosure Forms from other entities. AIs will decide who within the ETT-Registered Entity needs
                the disclosed information (or will confer with the person who has that authority). <b>Each ETT-Registered Entity creates its
                internal processes to satisfy all terms of use</b>.
